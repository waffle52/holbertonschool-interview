# 0x02-heap_insert
Write a function that creates a binary tree node:

    Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
    parent is a pointer to the parent node of the node to create
    value is the value to put in the new node
    When created, a node does not have any children
    Your function must return a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure
Write a function that inserts a value into a Max Binary Heap:

    Prototype: heap_t *heap_insert(heap_t **root, int value)
    root is a double pointer to the root node of the Heap
    value is the value store in the node to be inserted
    Your function must return a pointer to the inserted node, or NULL on failure
    If the address stored in root is NULL, the created node must become the root node.
    You have to respect a Max Heap ordering
    You are allowed to have up to 6 functions in your file
